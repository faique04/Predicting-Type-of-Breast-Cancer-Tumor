# Predicting-Type-of-Breast-Cancer-Tumor
Overarching Motivation: According to U.S. Breast Cancer Statistics “About 1 in 8 U.S. women (about 13%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime”. Same Statistics shows that “Breast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization”.
Breast Cancer is type of cancer that occur in Women and very rarely in men, is very lethal type of cancer with deathrate of about 2.6%. One of the key problems in it’s diagnostics is how to classify tumors into malignant(cancerous) or benign (no cancerous). Our main objective is to classify these tumors in order to identify Breast Cancer in early stages./n
Tentative Approach: Our tentative approach will be to utilize different features like radius_mean, texture_mean, smoothness_mean and texture_se of tumor and then apply Support Vector Machine using clustering.
Outcomes & Features: We will be using radius_mean, texture_mean, smoothness_mean, texture_se, perimeter_mean, compactness_mean and concave points_mean to visually differential both of the tumor type.
Tentative Data Source: Our tentative Data Source is from Kaggle and can be found on following link: https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset
